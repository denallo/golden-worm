# soup
I create this repo  without a definite goal, but feeling that I just need a definite zero point for getting start.
Working on this repo is working for myself. Something will be created, combined, reacted and evoluted. They get together and gradually develop into a soup. Maybe someday a definite thing, which could echo with my heart, will be born from it. Whether or not, just let me getting START.
